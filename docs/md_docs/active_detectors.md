# Active Detectors

Setup to make the output clean for the docs:
```python
%%capture
from threeML import silence_logs
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
silence_logs()
```

During the life of INTEGRAL/SPI several detectors stopped working correctly and were therefore disabled. In our analysis we need to take this into account, to not include a detector with 0 counts all the time and because the response for the surrounding detectors change when a detector is deactivated. 

In PySPI you can get for a given time, which detectors are active and which response version is valid at that time.

```python
time_string = "051212 205010" #"YYMMDD HHMMSS"; astropy time object also possible
```

To get the active single detectors for this time use:

```python
from pyspi.utils.livedets import get_live_dets
ld = get_live_dets(time_string, event_types="single")
print(f"Active detectors: {ld}")
```

It is also possible to plot the same version in a visual way. This shows the detector plane, and all the inactive detectors at this time are colored red.
```python
from pyspi.io.plotting.spi_display import SPI
s = SPI(time=time_string)
s.plot_spi_working_dets()
```

The response version at that time can be calculated with:
```python
from pyspi.utils.function_utils import find_response_version
v = find_response_version(time_string)
print(f"Response version number: {v}")
```
