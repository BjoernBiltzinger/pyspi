Welcome to PySpi's documentation!
====================================
.. image:: media/pypsi_logo2.png

PySpi is pure python interface to analyze Integral/SPI data. At the moment it allows to fit transient and constant point source and we want to include extended sources soon.

It provides plugins for [3ML](https://threeml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and therefore all the spectral models from [astromodels](https://astromodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are available for the fits. Check out these two software packages for more information.

This is still not a stable version. Bugs will occure sometimes, please open an issue on github if you find one.
