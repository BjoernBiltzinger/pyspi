        Function to construct the final energy bins that will be used in the analysis.
        Basically only does one thing: If the single events are included in the analysis
        it ensures that no energybin is covering simultaneously energy outside and inside
        of [psd_low_energy, psd_high_energy]. In this area the single detection photons
        that were not tested by the PSD suffer the "electronical noise" and are very unrealiable.
        The events that have passed the PSD test do not suffer from this "electronical noise".
        Thus we want to only use the PSD events in this energy range. Therefore we construct the
        ebins in such a way that there are ebins outside of this energy range, for which we will
        use normal single + psd events and ebins inside of this energy range for which we only
        want to use the psd events.
